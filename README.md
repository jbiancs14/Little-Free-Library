# Little-Free-Library
Digital representation of the Little Free Library organization which has managed to charter small "libraries" across the world.

 Each "library" encourages patrons to take a book or leave a book to promote the accessibility of books and reading in general. They are community spaces, many with benches or seats nearby and all are maintained by volunteers. We will be simulating an information management system to be used in these libraries.

 mplementing a digital representation of the Little Free Library (LFL) organization offers a rich opportunity to develop and apply essential software engineering skills. LFL’s concept of globally chartered libraries can be modeled effectively through object-oriented programming (OOP), where each library represents an instance of a class.

Using UML diagrams, software developers can visualize the structure of this system. For instance, a class diagram might include classes like Library, Book, and User. The Library class could encapsulate properties such as location, libraryID, and bookList, while the Book class could encapsulate title, author, and genre.

Encapsulation ensures that the internal state of objects is hidden from outside interference, achieved through getter and setter methods. For example, a setLocation method allows controlled updates to the library’s location. Meanwhile, constructors facilitate initializing objects with valid data, such as creating a Library object with a specific ID and location.

Creating methods like addBook, removeBook, or toString enhances functionality and debugging. The toString method provides a clear textual representation of a library’s attributes, useful for output or testing.

By implementing such a system, developers refine critical OOP skills, improve their ability to interpret UML diagrams, and enhance their understanding of encapsulation and method creation—all vital in software development.
